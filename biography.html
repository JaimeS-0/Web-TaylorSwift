                    <p class="textBiografhy" id="text_1">
                        Taylor Alison Swift was born on December 13, 1989, in Reading, Pennsylvania, United States. She is the daughter of Scott Swift, a financial advisor, and Andrea Gardner Finlay, a homemaker who previously worked as a 1  marketing executive.

                    <h2 id="primeros"> - Early life and musical beginnings </h2>

                    <p class="textBiografhy" id="text_2">
                        From a very young age, Taylor showed a great interest in music and poetry. At the age of nine, she began acting in local theater productions and participating in karaoke contests. Her family moved to Nashville, Tennessee, when she was fourteen years old to help her pursue her dream of becoming a country singer. In Nashville, Taylor signed a contract with Big Machine Records and released her self-titled debut album in 2006.

                    <p class="textBiografhy" id="text_3">
                        The album "Taylor Swift" (2006) was an immediate success, especially with singles like "Tim McGraw" and "Teardrops on My Guitar". Her second album, "Fearless" (2008), catapulted her to international fame with hits like "Love Story" and "You Belong with Me". This album won the Grammy for Album of the Year, making Taylor the youngest artist to receive this honor at that time.

                        "Taylor continued to evolve her musical style with each album. "Speak Now" (2010) was completely written by her and showcased her ability to tell personal stories. "Red" (2012) marked a transition to a more pop sound, with hits like "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together". With "1989" (2014), Taylor completely reinvented herself as a pop artist, winning another Grammy for Album of the Year."

                        In 2017, she released “Reputation“, a darker and more experimental album that addressed themes of fame and controversy. “Lover“ (2019) was a return to a more cheerful and romantic sound. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Taylor surprised her fans with two indie folk style albums: “Folklore“ and “Evermore“ (2020), both critically acclaimed.

                    <p id="tvtext">
                        When she was young, she signed a contract with a record label called Big Machine Records. Under that contract, she recorded her first six albums, but the record label retained the rights to her songs (what are called "masters", which are the original recordings)

                    <p id="tvtext_1">
                        Years later, Big Machine sold those rights to a businessman named Scooter Braun, who has had conflicts with Taylor. Since she couldn't buy her own recordings, she decided to re-record them from scratch. Thus, with the new versions (which bear the "(Taylor's Version)").
